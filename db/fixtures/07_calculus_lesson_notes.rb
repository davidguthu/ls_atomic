If you can avoid these, then at least your mistakes will be uncommon. Most of the mistakes that occur repeatedly involve algebra, rather than calculus. They can be avoided by being careful and checking your work. Others involve common misunderstandings about various aspects of calculus. \r\n", :is_document=>"TRUE"},
