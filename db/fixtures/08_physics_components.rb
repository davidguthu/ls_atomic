To do this, first define your coordinate system by drawing an \\( \\hat{x} \\) and a \\( \\hat y \\) direction. Then, complete the right triangle with \\( \\mathbf v \\) as the hypotenuse.

  {:id=>101434311, :course_id=>1, :name=>"How are two vectors added?", :description=>"Two vectors are most easily added component-by-component. If you decompose each vector into its horizontal and vertical components, vector addition is done by adding corresponding components. Graphically, this is equivalent to placing the vectors head-to-tail and drawing in the \"resultant\" vector from the tail of the first to the head of the second. To give an example, consider \\( mathbf v = v_x \\hat x + v_y \\hat y \\), and \\( mathbf w = w_x \\hat x + w_y \\hat y \\). Then, \\( \\mathbf v + \\mathbf w = (v_x + w_x) \\hat x + (v_y + w_y)\\hat y \\)."},

  {:id=>275025719, :course_id=>1, :name=>"When is an integral used?", :description=>"An integral can be thought of as a special type of sum. Imagine that we need to add the contribution of each particle in a body. Since a body has an extremely large number of particles, adding each one is highly impractical. Instead, we can assume that the contribution by each particle can be described by some kind of (integrable) function and the particles each give an infinitesimal contribution. Then we can integrate this function over all the particles. Another example: summing the contributions of bits of time to changing the position. The contributions are described by a function called velocity. So the change in position after a time interval is given by an integral of velocity over that time interval. "},
