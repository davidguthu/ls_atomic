You can think of this in terms of how one would have to pull the ball in-- by exerting a force on the string, over some displacement down the hollow center of the pole. Thus, you would *have* to do work on the ball, and by the work-energy theorem the kinetic energy of the ball would increase proportionally. This should be contrasted with the problem in which the string winds itself around the pole. Here, there is no work being done (because the string winds itself around the pole, no work has to be supplied by an external agent, and any motion of the end of the string as it winds is perpendicular to the tension in it), and every instant the ball is executing \"instantaneous circular motion\" about the contact point between the string and the pole; the tension is thus always perpendicular to the motion of the ball in this case.

Carefully draw a free body diagram for the streetcar while it is on the link of track connecting the two circular tracks. In the vertical direction, the force of gravity at all times balances the vertical component of the normal force of the track on the car, so there is no acceleration in the vertical direction and we may ignore it for the rest of this problem. In the horizontal direction, the streetcar is guided by the horizontal component of the normal force of the track on the wheels. This force is always normal to the direction of motion, so no work is done by this force. Therefore the streetcar's total kinetic energy does not change, and so its speed must remain constant.\n\nThis question is tricky, because our common experience suggests it should speed up-- after all, swinging a ball around on a string while pulling it inwards will cause it to speed up. However, in this later case, you are doing work on the ball via the tensional force, and thereby increasing its kinetic energy. In the case of the streetcar on the ice track, the normal force between the wheels and the track is *always* perpendicular to the motion and no work is done. In the case of the ice skater who draws his arms inwards and speeds up, he is changing his moment of inertia and to conserve angular momentum the angular velocity must increase.
