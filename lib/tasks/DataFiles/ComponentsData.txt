For rotation about some axis, we can relate the velocity of a small mass in the object to its angular velocity by \\( v = \\omega r \\). Thus, we substitute in to get \\[ \\text{K.E.} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 r^2 \\] Rearranging, we get \\[ \\frac{1}{2} m r^2 \\omega^2 \\] However, we notice that \\( m r^2 \\) is just the moment of inertia of that small mass. Integrating this over all masses in the object, we get \\[ \\int r^2 dm = I \\], or \\[ \\text{K.E.} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 \\]","name":"What is rotational kinetic energy?"},{"description":"\\( \\text{K.E.}_{\\text{rot.}} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 \\)","name":"How is the rotational kinetic energy related to the angular velocity?"}]
