The centripetal acceleration is *linear* in the radius \\( r \\) -- \\( a_c = \\omega^2 r \\). It is *not* inversely proportional to \\( r \\), as you might guess from the relation \\( a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\). This is because the velocity is proportional to \\( r \\) -- If you are sitting at the center of a rotating disk, you would have zero velocity."},{"playable_type":"Note","video_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otmg0-knGtE","end_time":411,"start_time":380,"lesson_id":14,"lesson_name":"Centripetal forces and accelerations","note_content":"END of introduction to centripetal acceleration"},{"playable_type":"Note","video_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otmg0-knGtE","end_time":415,"start_time":411,"lesson_id":14,"lesson_name":"Centripetal forces and accelerations","note_content":"Begin introduction to centripetal force"},{"playable_type":"Note","video_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otmg0-knGtE","end_time":435,"start_time":415,"lesson_id":14,"lesson_name":"Centripetal forces and accelerations","note_content":"Imagine you are sitting on a turntable rotating at angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) at a distance \\( r \\) from the center."},{"playable_type":"Note","video_url":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otmg0-knGtE","end_time":440,"start_time":435,"lesson_id":14,"lesson_name":"Centripetal forces and accelerations","note_content":"You must experience a centripetal acceleration \\( a_c = \\omega^2 r \\), this is non-negotiable because your velocity is changing!"},{"answer_type":"self-rate","explanation":"This centripetal acceleration must come from somewhere -- By Newton's 2nd law, accelerations must be caused by a force!
