145,1,Vector Math,How is a vector denoted?,"Learnstream uses boldface to indicate a vector, such as \( \textbf v \). Many sources use an arrow above the variable, as in \( \vec v \)"
146,2,Vector Math,What are the horizontal and vertical components of a vector?,"Given some vector \( \mathbf v \), we can decompose it into a sum of two orthogonal vectors \( \mathbf v_x \) and \( \mathbf v_y \). To do this, first define your coordinate system by drawing an \( \hat{x} \) and a \( \hat y \) direction. Then, complete the right triangle with \( \mathbf v \) as the hypotenuse. The x- and y- components will be the legs of that triangle along the \( \hat x \) and \( \hat y \) direction."
147,3,Vector Math,How are two vectors added?,"Two vectors are most easily added component-by-component. If you decompose each vector into its horizontal and vertical components, vector addition is done by adding corresponding components. Graphically, this is equivalent to placing the vectors head-to-tail and drawing in the ""resultant"" vector from the tail of the first to the head of the second. To give an example, consider \( mathbf v = v_x \hat x + v_y \hat y \), and \( mathbf w = w_x \hat x + w_y \hat y \). Then, \( \mathbf v + \mathbf w = (v_x + w_x) \hat x + (v_y + w_y)\hat y \)."
148,4,Vector Math,How are two vectors subtracted?,"To compute \( \mathbf a - \mathbf b \), find \( - \mathbf b \) by reversing the direction (flipping the signs) and then adding it to \( \mathbf a \). If you are subtracting two vectors using components, simply subtract the components of \( \mathbf b \) from the components of \( \mathbf a \).",How are two vectors added?
149,5,Vector Math,What vector properties can be considered component-wise?,"Vectors can be equated component-wise (all components must be equal for the vectors to be equal), and they can also be added, subtracted, and scaled (multiplied by a scalar) component-wise."

152,8,Vector Math,How is the dot product of two vectors calculated?,"The dot product \( \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v \) can be computed component-wise. That is, if \[ \mathbf u = u_x \hat x + u_y \hat y + u_z \hat z \] and \[ \mathbf v = v_x \hat x + v_y \hat y + v_z \hat z \] then \[ \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v = u_x v_x + u_y v_y + u_z v_z \] Note that the dot product is always a scalar!",,"OCW Lesson 3, Clip 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxLfUDyxVQs (3:44 - 9:05)
"
153,9,Vector Math,How is the cross product of two vectors calculated?,"We define the cross product \( \mathbf u \times \mathbf v \) as \[ \mathbf u \times \mathbf v = (u_y v_z - u_z v_y)\hat x + (u_z v_x - u_x v_z) \hat y + (u_x v_y - u_y v_x)\hat x \]  See OCW Lesson 3, Clip 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxLfUDyxVQs (9:10 - 11:00 )

154,10,Data Analysis,What are significant figures?,"Significant figures (or significant digits) are the digits in a number that contribute to its precision. If a scale reads \( 1.21 \times 10^1 \), this value has 3 significant digits meaning the final calculation should also have at most three significant digits."
155,11,Calculus Math,When is an integral used?,"An integral can be thought of as a special type of sum. Imagine that we need to add the contribution of each particle in a body. Since a body has an extremely large number of particles, adding each one is highly impractical. Instead, we can assume that the contribution by each particle can be described by some kind of (integrable) function and the particles each give an infinitesimal contribution. Then we can integrate this function over all the particles. Another example: summing the contributions of bits of time to changing the position. The contributions are described by a function called velocity. So the change in position after a time interval is given by an integral of velocity over that time interval. "
156,12,Calculus Math,How can an integral be simplified when the function is constant?,"Multiply the constant by the interval of integration. This is best seen graphically, as the integral is really just the area under the curve defined by the function. If the function is constant, the area under that function forms a rectangle with width equal to the length of the interval, and height equal to the constant function."
157,13,Calculus Math,What is the fundamental theorem of calculus?,"For all functions \( f \) for which there exists a function \(F\) such that \(\frac{d}{dt}(F) = f \) (i.e. the anti-derivative), the fundamental theorem of calculus states that  \[ \int_a^b f(t) dt = F(b) – F(a) \]"

159,15,Calculus Math,What are initial conditions?,"Initial conditions are the set of ""input parameters"" to a system. They often arise when dealing with a differential relationship, in which we need to specify some initial set of conditions that let us calculate exactly what the system will do given some differential equation."
160,16,Calculus Math,How do we often denote initial conditions?,"We often denote initial conditions with an ""i"" subscript on the variable of interest. For example, \( \mathbf v_i \) might be the initial velocity of an object. Sometimes, a ""0"" (for ""naught"") is used in place of the ""i"": \( \mathbf v_0 \)."
161,17,Graphical Analysis,How can position be determined from a graph of velocity-time?,"Since velocity is defined as \( v = \frac{d x}{dt} \) and so \( x = \int v dt \), we can find the change in position over some time interval on a velocity-time graph by measuring or calculating the area under the curve. "
162,18,Graphical Analysis,How can velocity be determined on a graph of position-time?,"Since velocity is just the derivative of position, the instantaneous velocity at some time \( t \) is just the slope of the tangent line on a position-time graph. We can find the average velocity between two points \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) by finding the slope of the line segment connecting those two points on the graph!"

Thus, we can find the change in velocity over some time interval on an acceleration-time graph by measuring or calculating the area under the curve."
164,20,Graphical Analysis,How can acceleration be determined on a graph of velocity-time?,"Since acceleration is just \( a = \frac{dv}{dt} \), the acceleration can be found from a velocity-time graph by finding the slope of the tangent line at the point of interest. We can likewise calculate the average acceleration between times \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) by finding the slope of the line that connects those points on the velocity-time graph."

166,22,Coordinate Systems,How should coordinates be used for a system of pulleys?,"Typically, only one axis is needed, and it follows the direction of the rope. You should define a consistent positive direction by guessing the direction of motion, and then use that in your force-balance equations. If the ultimate answer comes out negative, it means motion in the opposite direction from the one you defined, but that is ok because the +/- is just a convention based on how we defined our coordinate system!"
167,23,Coordinate Systems,Which coordinate system should be chosen for a problem with [SYMMETRY]?,Choose the coordinate system that reflects the symmetry!
168,24,Symmetries,What is linear (translational) symmetry?,"Linear translational symmetry appears when an object can be moved in a straight line without appearing any different to the observer. For example, an infinite line has translational symmetry because we can move it to the left or right (along the line) and it doesn't look any different to us."
169,25,Symmetries,What is cylindrical symmetry?,"Cylindrical symmetry, appears in problems with linear translational symmetry along one axis and rotational symmetry about that axis (thus, it looks like an infinitely-long cylinder!)"
170,26,Symmetries,What is spherical symmetry?,Spherical symmetry arises in situations where rotating about a point (at constant radius) makes no difference in the setup of the problem. Think of a ball which can be rotated into any orientation but still appears the same.

181,37,Momentum Conservation,When does conservation of momentum apply?,"Conservation of momentum applies when there are no net external forces acting on an object. We can see this directly from Newton's second law: \( F = m \cdot \frac{dv}{dt} \Rightarrow F = \frac{dp}{dt} \), since \( p = mv \). ""Conservation of momentum"" means that the momentum is not changing in time. Thus, for momentum to be conserved, \( \frac{dp}{dt} = 0 \rightarrow F=0 \). Thus, conservation of momentum applies when there are no external forces."
182,38,Momentum Conservation,What is true about initial and final momentum of a system if momentum is conserved?,"The initial momentum equals the final momentum, or \( p_i = p_f \)."
183,39,Energy Conservation,When does conservation of energy apply?,"Conservation of energy always applies. It is typically only useful when there is some type of conversion between types of energy. It's also a statement about the universe, so it cannot be applied to an isolated system if there is energy going in or out of the system. Finally, be aware the energy may be transferred to heat. For instance, kinetic energy is conserved only in a perfectly elastic collision. [Break up this component??]"

201,57,Newton's Second Law,What is Newton's second law?,"Newton's second law states that the net force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration. It is often written \[ \mathbf F = m \mathbf a \] or equivalently, it is written \[ \mathbf F = \frac{d \mathbf p }{dt} \] because a net force always induces a change in momentum. The equivalence of these can be shown by re-writing \( \mathbf p = m \mathbf v \) and then realizing that \( \mathbf a = \frac{d \mathbf v}{dt} \)."
202,58,Types of Forces,What forces can potentially act on a system?,"The types of forces acting on a system can be divided into two types-- gravitational forces and contact forces. That's it! A contact force arises when two bodies are in contact with each other. We decompose the contact force into a frictional force (which acts parallel to the surface) and a normal force (which acts perpendicular to the surface). Contact forces can also come from some action on a body, like a tension force from a rope attached to the body."
203,59,Gravitation,When does gravity act on an object?,"Gravity acts between any two bodies. Typically, we assume that events occur on the surface of the earth, where the attractive force between the Earth is always dominating. This force causes the common \( 9.8 m/s^2 \) acceleration that is typically assumed."
204,60,Gravitation,Where does the force of gravity originate when it acts on a body?,"For rigid bodies, the force of gravity always acts through the center of mass."

206,62,Gravitation,In which direction does the force of gravity act?,The force of gravity acts towards the center of mass of the attractive body.
207,63,Types of Forces,When do frictional forces act on an object?,"Frictional forces act on an object when that object is in contact with another object. The strength of the frictional force depends on the coefficient of friction and the normal force between the two objects. It also scales depending on other forces acting on the object, balancing them up to some critical threshold."
208,64,Types of Forces,In which direction does a frictional force act?,"The frictional force always acts in the direction opposite of intended motion; that is, it provides a counter-active force to whatever forces might be causing that object to accelerate."
209,65,Types of Forces,What is the magnitude of the static friction force?,"The frictional force is \[ F_f \le \mu_s F_N \] where \( \mu_s \) is the coefficient of static friction and \( F_N \) is the normal force. The magnitude is always the value it needs to be to counteract other forces acting on the object, up to the critical ""slip"" threshold of \( \mu_s F_N \)."
210,66,Types of Forces,When does a normal force act on an object?,"A normal force is an application of Newton's third law. When an object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object. The normal force applies when an object, such as a block resting on a surface, exerts a force of gravity. "
211,67,Types of Forces,In which direction does a normal force act?,"The normal force is a contact force, and is supplied when two objects are in contact with each other. The normal force gets its name from ""normal"", which is a synonym for ""perpendicular"". Thus, the normal force acts perpendicular to the surface. Any contact force between objects can be decomposed into a normal force (perpendicular to their contact surface) and a force parallel to that surface, which would be caused by some frictional force."
212,68,Types of Forces,What is the magnitude of a normal force?,"The magnitude of the normal force must be calculated for the particular problem, but can be found by writing down a force-balance equation for the direction perpendicular to the surface of contact."
213,69,Equilibrium,When is a system in static equilibrium?,"A system is in static equilibrium when all particles are at rest. By definition, the forces acting on the system must be balanced."
214,70,Equilibrium,When should a balance of forces be assumed?,"Forces are in balance when a) there are no forces, or b) the sum of all force vectors is zero, i.e., the horizontal and vertical components of the forces cancel out. This occurs exactly when no particles in the system have acceleration, so each is either remaining at rest or moving at constant velocity (by Newton's first law). Examples: pulling a block up a hill at constant velocity, a system of pulleys that is balanced",What vector properties can be considered component-wise?
215,71,Equilibrium,How are unknown forces found?,"If the forces in a system are balanced, we can determine an unknown force by vector algebra. The sum of all forces is an equation that sums to zero, and the unknown force is the unknown variable. For a coordinate system with n-dimensions, we actually have n equations by letting each component sum to zero, so we can find n unknown forces. (Most problems will have n=2.)"
216,72,Types of Problems,What is the difference between an elastic and inelastic collision?,"The only difference is that when the object remain attached after the collision (inelastic), they have one combined mass and velocity. Otherwise, they have two distinct masses and velocities. In both cases, they are considered a closed system (so conservation of momentum applies). For elastic collisions only, kinetic energy is conserved."
217,73,Types of Problems,"What does ""rotation without slipping"" mean?","Rotating without slipping simply means that an object is rolling along some surface without slipping or skidding; that is, its velocity exactly matches the rate at which it is rotating. For something that rolls without slipping, we know that \[ v = \omega r \] must hold."
218,74,Common Definitions,What is position?,"Position is given by a point in some coordinate system. Commonly it is given in cartesian coordinates, meaning the position of an object is determined by an x, y, and z-coordinate."

257,113,Common Definitions,What are the units of rotational kinetic energy?,"Rotational kinetic energy is just an energy, so the unit is the Joule (J). We can see this too from dimensional analysis of the equation \( \text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \), since the moment of inertia \( I \) has units of mass times distance squared, and the angular velocity has units of \( 1/s \), we find \[ \left[ \text{K.E.} \right] = \frac{\left[ kg \right] \left[ m \right]}{\left[s\right]^2} \rightarrow \left[ J \right] \]"
258,114,Common Definitions,What is power?,"Power is work done over some time interval. For example, if a force does some work \( W \) over some time \( \Delta t \), the power is just \[ \text{Power} = \frac{W}{\Delta t} \] In precise terms, power is defined as the instantaneous time rate of change of work, or \[ P = \frac{d W}{dt} \]"
259,115,Common Definitions,What are the units for power?,1 watt (W) = 1 J/s,What is power? What are the units for energy?
260,116,Common Definitions,What is impulse?,"Impulse is just the change in momentum, and arises when a force acts over some time interval \( \Delta t \). We can think of impulse then as \( \textbf I = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \textbf F \cdot dt \), but since \( \mathbf F = \frac{d\mathbf p}{dt} \) we find that \[ \mathbf{I} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \frac{d \mathbf p}{dt} dt \rightarrow \int_{t_1}^{t_2} d \mathbf p = \Delta \mathbf p \]",What is force?
261,117,Common Definitions,What are the units of impulse?,"Since impulse is just a change in momentum, the units are those of momentum, or kilogram-meters per second \( kg-m/s \)."
262,118,Common Definitions,What is pressure?,Pressure is a force per unit area.
263,119,Common Definitions,What are the units of pressure?,"Because pressure is force per area, its units are just \( \frac{[N]}{[ m ]^2} \)."
264,120,Common Definitions,What is the moment of inertia?,"Moment of inertia, \( I \), is the analogy to mass for a body in rotational motion. We must be concerned with the distribution of mass related to the axis of rotation, so that is taken into account for the moment of inertia: different shapes have different moments of inertia, as do the same shape rotating along different axes! Moment of inertia can be found by summing or integrating the quantity \( mr^2 \) over all particles for a body. That is, \[ I = \int r^2 dm \] where we integrate up each little mass element weighted by its perpendicular distance squared from the axis of rotation. It is important to realize that the moment of inertia depends on the *configuration of masses around some axis*. Thus, an object will have different moments of inertia about different points of rotation.",When is an integral used?
265,121,Common Definitions,What are the units for moment of inertia?,\( \text{kg m}^2 \),What is rotational inertia or moment of inertia?
266,122,Common Definitions,What is the intuitive understanding of moment of inertia?,"The moment of inertia for an object is an expression of how resistant it is to torques. That is, an object with a high moment of inertia will require a large torque to begin rotating, whereas an object with a small moment of inertia will easily rotate with a small applied torque. It is the rotational equivalent of mass (which after all, is only a measure of how resistant a body is to accelerating under an applied force!). Mathematically, the moment of inertia is determined entirely by how the mass is distributed in an object, where we weight each little piece of mass by its distance squared from the axis of rotation. Thus, masses that are further away from the axis will contribute way more (by the distance squared!) to the moment of inertia than masses located close in to the axis of rotation."
267,123,Common Definitions,What is the parallel axis theorem?,"If you know the moment of inertia of an object about some axis of rotation, you can find the moment of inertia about any other axis that is parallel to this first axis. To do so, you take the moment of inertia \( I_0 \) about the original axis and add \( m d^2 \) where \( d \) is the perpendicular distance between the two axes. Thus, the new moment of inertia (about the shifted axis) is just \[ I = I_0 + m d^2 \] This is useful in a lot of problems where we can make torques disappear by defining a new axis of rotation, but then need to find the altered moment of inertia for an object rotating about this new axis."
268,124,Common Definitions,What is torque?,"Torque is a vector quantity, defined as \[ \mathbf \tau = \mathbf r \times \mathbf F \] It is the rotational analogue of force, and is just the force acting at some distance \( mathbf r \) away from an axis of rotation."
269,125,Common Definitions,What are the units for torque?,"\( \text N \cdot \text m \) (Note this is the same units as work, but the joule is not used because work is a force acting *over some distance* (given in meters), whereas a torque is a force acting *at* some distance away from an axis of rotation.)",What is torque?
270,126,Common Definitions,What is rotational kinetic energy?,"The rotational kinetic energy of an object is given by \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \] This has a unique relationship to traditional kinetic energy, \( \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \). For rotation about some axis, we can relate the velocity of a small mass in the object to its angular velocity by \( v = \omega r \). Thus, we substitute in to get \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \] Rearranging, we get \[ \frac{1}{2} m r^2 \omega^2 \] However, we notice that \( m r^2 \) is just the moment of inertia of that small mass. Integrating this over all masses in the object, we get \[ \int r^2 dm = I \], or \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \]",When is an integral used?
271,127,Common Definitions,How is the rotational kinetic energy related to the angular velocity?,\( \text{K.E.}_{\text{rot.}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \)
272,128,Newton's First Law,What is Newton's first law?,Newton's first law states that objects at rest will remain at rest and objects in motion will remain in motion until they are acted upon by an external force. Another way to state this is an object with constant velocity (possibly zero velocity) will stay moving at that velocity unless it experiences a net external force. This can be derived from Newton's second law.
273,129,Newton's Third Law,What is Newton's third law?,"Newton's third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If Object 1 exerts a force on Object 2, then by Newton's third law we know that Object 2 exerts an equal force on Object 1, in the opposite direction."
274,130,Kinematics Concepts,What is the motion of an object under free-fall near the earth's surface?,"In free-fall motion near the earth, the only force acting on an object is the force due to gravity, which causes an acceleration of \( 9.8 \units{m/s^2} \) straight downwards. This is constant acceleration motion, and so all of the kinematics equations we derived will apply."
275,131,Vector Math,When are two vectors perpendicular?,"Two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is zero. That is, \( \vec A \) and \( \vec B \) are perpendicular if \( \vec A \cdot \vec B  = 0 \)"
276,132,Vector Math,When are two vectors parallel?,Two vectors are parallel if they are scalar multiples of each other.
277,133,Vector Math,What is the magnitude of a vector?,"The magnitude of a vector is just its length, and is denoted by vertical bars \( |\mathbf A| \). It is a scalar value, and can be calculated for some vector \( \vec A \) by doing: \[ \vec A = A_x \hat x + A_y \hat y + A_z \hat z \rightarrow |\mathbf A| = \sqrt{ A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2} \]"
278,134,Vector Math,What is the effect of scalar multiplication on a vector?,"Scalar multiplication, or the multiplication of a vector by a scale, does exactly what it sounds like-- scales the vector! For some vector \( \mathbf A \), we can multiply it by some scalar \( c \) to get \[ c \mathbf A = c A_x \hat x + c A_y \hat y + c A_z \hat z \] It does not change the direction of the vector."
279,135,Vector Math,What is the right hand rule?,"The right hand rule is a ""rule of thumb"" for computing cross products, and determines which direction the resultant vector points."
280,136,Common Definitions,What is displacement?,"Displacement is a vector quantity, equal to a difference in position."
281,137,Common Definitions,What is distance?,"Distance is a scalar quantity, equal to how far an object travels. It is the integral of speed over time, and should not be confused with displacement (a vector quantity)."
282,138,Common Definitions,What is apparent weight?,"Apparent weight is the force supplied to a body by either a tension or a normal force, eg, from a scale. In static equilibrium, the apparent weight \( F_w \) is equal to the weight of gravity \( F_g = mg \). However, if an object is accelerating (like someone standing on a scale in an elevator accelerating upwards), then the apparent weight will change because the normal/tensional force must be larger than the force of gravity in order to cause the upward acceleration. Simply put, the apparent weight is what you would measure standing on a scale."
283,139,Common Definitions,What are the conditions for free-fall?,"""Free-fall"" occurs when your apparent weight goes to zero. That is, you are accelerating under the influence of the gravitational force alone."
284,140,Coordinate Systems,What is the difference between a right-handed and a left-handed coordinate system?,"We almost exclusively use right-handed coordinate systems. A right-handed coordinate system is one in which \[ \uvec x \times \uvec y = + \uvec z \] A left-handed coordinate system is one in which \[ \uvec x \times \uvec y = - \uvec z \] Here, one would use a ""left-hand rule"" instead of a ""right-hand rule"" to get equivalent physics."
285,141,Common Definitions,What is centripetal acceleration?,"Centripetal acceleration is any acceleration directed towards the center of a circle. It most often arises in the context of uniform circular motion, in which an object is rotating in a circle. Because its velocity is constantly changing direction, it must be experiencing a force (by Newton's 2nd law), and this force is the centripetal force. For uniform circular motion, the centripetal force can be written \[ a_c = \omega^2 r \] or alternatively \[ a_c = \frac{v^2}{r} \] Note, however, the centripetal acceleration is *linear* in \( r \), not inversely proportional -- the \( v \) has a hidden \( r \) in it, and so the definition \( a_c = \omega^2 r \) is preferable conceptually."
286,142,Common Definitions,What is the centripetal force?,"The centripetal force is any force directed towards the center of a circle. It most often arises in the context of uniform circular motion, in which a force is needed to maintain an object's circular trajectory. This is the force *causing* the centripetal acceleration, which causes the object to move in a circle."
287,143,Common Definitions,What is frequency?,"Frequency \( f \), or \( \nu \), is the number of cycles per second, measured in Hertz. It is used to describe things with periodic motion or behavior and is related to the period by \[ f = \frac{1}{T} \]"
288,144,Common Definitions,What is the period in rotational kinetics?,"The period \( T \) is the amount of time required for one full cycle or oscillation. It is used to describe things with periodic motion or behavior, and is related to the frequency by \[ T = \frac{1}{f} \]"
289,145,Types of Forces,What is the magnitude of the kinetic friction force?,"The force of kinetic friction, \( F_k \), is given by \[ F_k = \mu_k F_N \] where \( \mu_k \) is the coefficient of kinetic friction and \( F_N \) is the normal force. Typically, the coefficient of kinetic friction \( \mu_k \) is less than the coefficient of static friction, \( \mu_s \)."
290,146,Reference Frames,What is an inertial reference frame?,"The laws of physics appear identical for all observers in inertial reference frames. An inertial reference frame is one in which there are no accelerations, meaning ""stationary"" and ""constant motion"" reference frames. However, one observer in a ""constant motion"" frame can equally well claim to be at ""rest"" relative to you (FIX, MAKE BETTER...)"
291,147,Reference Frames,What is a non-inertial reference frame?,"A non-inertial reference frame is one in which there are accelerations. For example, all rotating reference frames are non-inertial (although for ""slow"" enough rotation, they can approximate inertial reference frames), as are reference frames undergoing rectilinear acceleration."
292,148,Common Definitions,What is tension?,"Tension is the magnitude of the pulling force exerted by a string, cable, chain, or similar object on another object. It is a force, and hence is measured in Newtons, and can be thought of as an intrinsic property at every point in a rope or cable that would pull apart a thin slice in that rope. FIX!"
293,149,Types of Forces,What is the difference between centripetal and centrifugal force?,"Centripetal force is a *real* force, while centrifugal force is a *pseudo-force*. In cases of circular motion, the centripetal force is the force directed towards the center of the circle, and *causes* the circular motion-- without it, the object would continue in a straight line (by Newton's 1st law). The centrifugal force is an artifact of being in the non-inertial, rotating reference frame. It seems like a real force for the rotating object, but it is just a consequence of the non-inertial frame. When doing circular motion problems, you should always analyze things from an inertial reference frame, in which case the centrifugal force will never appear but you will always have a centripetal force causing the circular motion."
294,150,Common Definitions,What direction does the centripetal force/centripetal acceleration point?,"The centripetal force (and by Newton's 2nd law, the centripetal acceleration) both point directly towards the center of a circular path. ""Centripetal"" means ""towards the center""."
295,151,Types of Forces,What is the magnitude of the centripetal force for uniform circular motion?,"The centripetal force has magnitude \[ F_c = m \omega^2 r \] or in terms of the speed \( v \) of the rotating object, it is \[ F_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} \] The centripetal force is related to the centripetal acceleration by Newton's 2nd law, where \[ F_c = m a_c \]"
296,152,Energy Conservation,What is the work-energy theorem?,"The work-energy theorem states that the change in kinetic energy of a system is equal to the work done by the net of all forces on a system. Mathematically, this is \[ W_{\text{net}} = \Delta \text{K.E.} \] Note, if the object has a change in potential energy, this has to be accounted for in the net work as work done by the *gravitational force*. "
297,153,Vector Math,What is the dot product between perpendicular vectors?,The dot product between perpendicular vectors is always zero. This can be seen by direct calculation from the geometric definition of the dot product: \[ \mathbf A \cdot \mathbf B = |\mathbf A||\mathbf B| \cos 90^\circ = 0 \] since the angle between perpendicular vectors is (of course) \( 90^\circ \) and \( \cos 90^\circ = 0 \).
298,154,Work,How do you determine the sign of the work done on a system?,"The sign comes directly from the definition: \[ W = \int \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf x \] If the force is acting in the same direction as the displacement (or some component is acting in the direction of the displacement), then the sign is positive because the force is essentially ""working with"" the object. If the force is acting in the opposite direction as the displacement, the sign is negative (the force is acting ""against"" the object's motion). If the force is *perpendicular* to the displacement, then it does zero work."
299,155,Gravitation,What is gravitational potential energy?,"Between any two objects, the gravitational potential energy is \[ U_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r} \] Near the surface of the earth, where the force due to gravity is essentially constant, the gravitational potential energy reduces to \( U = m g h \). TYPE UP A DERIVATION...!!!"
300,156,Energy,What is the potential energy stored in a spring?
301,157,,What is the force exerted by a compressed spring?,"Using Hooke's law, we know the force is \( F_{\text{spring}} = - k \Delta x \) where \( x \) is the compression length and \( k \) is the spring constant. Note, the negative sign means this is always a ""restorative"" force; it always acts to restore the spring to its natural uncompressed state."
302,158,Common Definitions,What is the definition of kinetic energy in terms of momentum?,"In terms of velocity, kinetic energy is just \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \] The momentum \( p \) of an object is \( p = m v \), and so \[ v = \frac{p}{m} \] Substituting this in, we get \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{p^2}{2m} \]"
303,159,Vector Math,What direction does the cross product point?,"The direction of the cross product is **always** perpendicular to the two vectors in the product. Thus, if \[ \mathbf A \times \mathbf B = \mathbf C \] the vector \( \mathbf C \) is perpendicular to both \( \mathbf A \) and \( \mathbf B \). There are, of course, two such perpendicular vectors pointing in exactly opposite directions, and hence we use the right hand rule to figure out which one by definition."
304,160,Equilibrium,When should a balance of torques be assumed?,"Torque-balance is used for rotational equilibrium problems, that is, in problems where the objects are free to rotate but are in a state of rotational equilibrium (not rotating). This comes from the rotational equivalent of Newton's 2nd law, or \[ \mathbf \tau = I \mathbf \alpha \] Thus, if there are no net torques (ie, all torques are balanced) then the system will not accelerate."
305,161,Conservation of Angular Momentum,When is angular momentum conserved?,Angular momentum is conserved when there are no net external torques acting on a system.
306,162,Rotational Kinematics,How is rotational kinetic energy related to angular momentum and the moment of inertia?,"We start with \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \] and know that for rigidly rotating bodies, \[ L = I \omega \] Thus, we find that \[ \text{K.E.} = \frac{L^2}{2I} \]"
