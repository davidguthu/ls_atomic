1,"130,76,27",,"Two stones are released from rest at a certain height, one after the other. Will the difference between their speeds increase, decrease, or stay the same?
",multi,2,"Neglecting friction due to air resistance, both stones will accelerate with the same constant acceleration, the acceleration due to gravity ( \( \approx 9.8 \units{m/s^2} \) ). We know that if the first stone is dropped at \( t = 0 \), its speed can be written as \[ v_1(t) = g t + v_{1,0} = gt \] since it starts from rest, \( v_{1,0} = 0 \). Similarly, the speed of the second stone can be written \[ v_2(t) = g (t - t_0) \] where \( t_0 \) is the time at which the second stone is dropped. We see that the difference between their speeds is \[ v_1(t) - v_2(t) = g t -  g(t - t_0) = g t_0 \] Since both \( g \) and \( t_0 \) are constants, the difference in speeds is always constant.",increase,decrease,stay the same

We can also think of this in terms of the cross product multiplying perpendicular components. Because \( \mathbf A \) lies entirely in the \( \hat x \) direction, and \( \mathbf B \) has components along the \( hat x \) and \( hat z \), the cross product \( \mathbf A \times \mathbf B \) only cares about the components that are perpendicular, or in other words, it reduces to looking at \( \hat x \times \hat z \) because we don't care about the \( \hat x \) component in vector \( \mathbf B \).

90,"58,65,68",,"The angle of repose is the maximum slope on which an object will not slide. On airless, geologically inert bodies like the moon or an asteroid, the only thing that determines whether dust or rubble will stay on a slope is whether the slope is less steep than the angle of repose.  (a) Find an equation for the angle of repose, deciding for yourself what are the relevant variables.  (b) On an asteroid, where \(g\) can be thousands of times lower than on Earth, would rubble be able to lie at a steeper angle of repose? ",self-rate,"(a) \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(\mu_s) \)
(b) the angle of repose is the same on both the asteroid and the moon","(a) If there was no friction, the angle of repose would be zero, so the coefficient of static friction, \(\mu_s\), will definitely matter. We also make up symbols \(\theta\), \(m\) and \(g\) for the angle of the slope, the mass of the object, and the acceleration of gravity. The force from static friction \(F_s\) has a maximum magnitude of \(\mu_s |N|\), where \(|N|=mg \cos\theta \). Therefore the component of gravitational force pointing down the slope, given by \(mg\sin\theta\) can be at most \(mu_smg\cos\theta\). Setting the frictional force to the maximum, we solve for \(\theta\) as \[\begin{align} \mu_smg\cos\theta=mg\sin\theta \\ \theta=\tan^{-1}(\mu_s\). \end{align}\] (b) Both \(m\) and \(g\) canceled out, so the angle of repose would be the same on an asteroid."
