[{"answer_type":"text","explanation":"Neglecting friction due to air resistance, both stones will accelerate with the same constant acceleration, the acceleration due to gravity ( \\( \\approx 9.8 \\units{m/s^2} \\) ). We know that if the first stone is dropped at \\( t = 0 \\), its speed can be written as \\[ v_1(t) = g t + v_{1,0} = gt \\] since it starts from rest, \\( v_{1,0} = 0 \\). Similarly, the speed of the second stone can be written \\[ v_2(t) = g (t - t_0) \\] where \\( t_0 \\) is the time at which the second stone is dropped. We see that the difference between their speeds is \\[ v_1(t) - v_2(t) = g t -  g(t - t_0) = g t_0 \\] Since both \\( g \\) and \\( t_0 \\) are constants, the difference in speeds is always constant.","answer":"stay the same&same","question":"Two stones are released from rest at a certain height, one after the other.
