You are hopefully learning that calculus is a valuable tool. One of the most important applications of differential calculus is to find **extreme function values**. The calculus methods for finding the maximum and minimum values of a function are the basic tools of **optimization theory**, a very active branch of mathematical research applied to nearly all fields of practical endeavor. Although modern optimization theory is considerably more advanced, its methods and fundamental ideas clearly show a historical relationship to the calculus. In this tutorial you will review how the second derivative of a function is related to the shape of its graph and how that information can be used to classify relative extreme values. 

#### The First Derivative Test...

If you have not already done so, you should review the tutorial on the __First Derivative__. You can also find more information on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_derivative_test) and elsewhere. The picture below summarizes the key ideas:
