Intuitively, we say that \(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c} f(x)=L\) if \(f\) is defined near (but not necessarily at) \(c\) and \(f(x)\) approaches \(L\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\). 

If we let \(x\) approach \(c\) from the left side only, we write \(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c^-} f(x)\) since \(x\) is approaching \(c\) from smaller values. Similarly, for \(x\) approaching \(c\) from the right, we write \(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c^+} f(x)\). The __two-sided__ limit \(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c} f(x)\) exists if and only if both of these __one-sided__ limits exist and are equal.
