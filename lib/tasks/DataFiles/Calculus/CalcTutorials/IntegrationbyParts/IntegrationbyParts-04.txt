#### Key Concepts (review)

\[\int u\, dv=uv-\int v\, du.\] 

  * Choose \(u\), \(dv\) in such a way that: 

    1. \(u\) is easy to _differentiate_. 
    2. \(dv\) is easy to _integrate_. 
    3. \(\displaystyle\int\! v\, du\) is easier to compute that \(\displaystyle\int\! u\, dv\). 

  * Sometimes it is necessary to integrate by parts more than once.
