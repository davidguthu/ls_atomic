\[  \frac{1}{x+y} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}  \]     

**MISTAKE!**

The rule for adding fractions gives \[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{x+y}{xy}. \] 

You have to do this by first putting them over a common denominator:

\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{y}{xy} + \frac{x}{xy} = \frac{x+y}{xy} \] as shown above.
