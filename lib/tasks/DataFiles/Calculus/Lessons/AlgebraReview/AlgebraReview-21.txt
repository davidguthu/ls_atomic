Thinking you're prepared when you're not.  **MISTAKE!**

This mistake is perhaps the most important. The worst mistake many students make is to think they know the material better than they really do. It's easy to fool yourself into thinking you can solve a problem when you're looking at the answer book or at a worked out solution. Test your knowledge by trying problems under exam conditions. If you can do them under that restriction, the exam should be a breeze.

Before an exam, it's a good idea to work through all of the practice problems from lecture __by yourself__, or __with a group of friends__ so you can help each other. Don't just read through the professor's solutions or the solutions in your notes.
