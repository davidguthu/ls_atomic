Many integrals are most easily computed by means of a change of variables, commonly called a **\(u\)-substitution**.

The substitution method amounts to applying the Chain Rule in reverse. That is, to compute an integral of the form
\[ \int f(g(x))g'(x)\, dx\] 
we let \[ u = g(x) \rightarrow du = g'(x) dx\] 

Then,
\[\int f(g(x)) g'(x)\, dx = \int f(u)\, du = F(u) = F(g(x)) \] 
where \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\).

Let's look at some examples to make this clearer!
