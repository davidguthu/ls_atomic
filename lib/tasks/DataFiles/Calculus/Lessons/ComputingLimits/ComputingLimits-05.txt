### Key Concepts

Let \(f\) be defined at all \(x\) in an open interval containing \(c\), except possibly at \(c\) itself. 

Then \[\lim_{x\to c} f(x)=L\] if and only if for each \(\varepsilon >0\), there exists a \(\delta >0\) such that \[{\small\textrm{if }} 0<|x-c|<\delta {\small\textrm{ then }}|f(x)-L|<\varepsilon.\] In words, \(\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c} f(x)=L\) if and only if by taking \(x\) close enough to \(c\) we can get \(f(x)\) arbitrarily close to \(L\).
