#### Concavity and the Second Derivative

The important result that relates the concavity of the graph of a function to its derivatives is the following one: 

**Concavity Theorem**: If the function \(f\) is twice differentiable at \(x=c\), then the graph of \(f\) is concave upward at \((c,f(c))\) if \(f''(c) > 0\) and concave downward if \(f''(c) < 0\). 

#### Example

Suppose \(f(x) = x^3 -3x^2 + x - 2.\) Let's determine where the graph of \(f\) is concave up and where it is concave down. Since \(f\) is twice-differentiable for all \(x\), we use the result given above and first determine that \(f''(x) = 6(x -1)\). Thus, \(f''(x) > 0\) if \(x > 1\) and \(f''(x) < 0\) if \(x < 1\). By the Concavity Theorem, the graph of \(f\) is concave up for \(x > 1\) and concave down for \(x < 1\). 

#### Inflection Points

Notice in the example above, that the concavity of the graph of \(f\) _changes sign at \(x = 1\)_. Points on the graph of \(f\) where the concavity changes from up-to-down or down-to-up are called **inflection points** of the graph. The following result connects the concept of inflection points to the derivatives properties of the function: 

**Inflection Point Theorem:** If \(f'(c)\) exists and \(f''(c)\) _changes sign at \(x=c\)_, then the point \((c,f(c))\) is an **inflection point** of the graph of \(f\). If \(f''(c)\) exists at the inflection point, then \(f''(c) = 0\). 

If we return to our example, where \(f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + x -2\), the ** Inflection Point Theorem** verifies that the graph of \(f\) has an inflection point at \(x = 1\), since \(f''(1) = 0\).
