#### Even/Odd Functions

A function \(f:A\to B\) is said to be **even** if and only if \[f(-x)=f(x)\quad {\small\textrm{for all }} x\in A\] and is said to be **odd** if and only if \[f(-x)=-f(x)\quad {\small\textrm{for all }} x\in A.\] Most functions are neither even nor odd.

The graph of an even function is symmetric about the __y__-axis, while the graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin.

Of the functions in the example,

  * \(f(x)=x^2\) is even.   
  

  * \(f(x)=\sin x\) is odd.   
  

  * The others are neither even nor odd.
